# Memory Game Project

The Memory Game project is a simple yet challenging way to test one's coding skills. In order to complete this project, you'll have to get confortable with DOM manipulation and event handlers, amongst other things.

# How do I play?

You have to find matches. In order to do so, start by "opening" (selecting) pairs of cards and try to remember the position of each figure.
If you match an open card with another one with the same figure, the cards stay open.


## How do I win?

You win by finding all matches, that is, by finding where each pair of matching figures is located.


## Is there a score?

Yes! The score is based on the amount of moves it takes you to win, the criteria is as follows:

- 3 stars : 16 moves or less
- 2 stars : Between 17 and 21 moves
- 1 star  : More than 21 moves


## What if I get stuck and want to start over with a different deck?

If you get bored/pissed at the current arrengement of the cards, you can shuffle them by clicking the "start over" button located next to the timer.
